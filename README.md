# a2pd-hsp-hfs-converter
Having just been through a mountain of issues when converting to bluetooth from wire on my Ubuntu machine. I have created a tool to swtich between a2pd (Good audio) and hps/hfs(To be able to use the microphone. This is done automatically on mobile but has to be done manually on linux so I created a simple script)
