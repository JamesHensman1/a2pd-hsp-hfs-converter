# a2pd-hsp-hfs-converter

### motivation
Having just been through a mountain of issues when converting to bluetooth from wire on my Ubuntu machine. I have created a tool to swtich between a2pd (Good audio) and hps/hfs(To be able to use the microphone. This is done automatically on mobile but has to be done manually on linux so I created a simple script)


Requirements: 
* pacmd and pactl (comes with pulse audio)
* espeak (optional, will tell you the mode of operation)

Install: 
* Place script in a location of choice
* set a trigger: keybinds, panel tool, etc.
* Save time not having to use a bluetooth manager to get good audio when listening to music and calling
